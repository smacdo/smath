smath
=====

## Overview
A simple 2D and 3D math library, designed for game development.

## Usage
Check the code out to an directory in your project (eg, thirdparty/smath),
include it in your build and you should be good to go. Check out the build
options in the CMakeLists.txt file if you want to customize the library.

## Status
I recently extracted all of my math files from various graphics demos I've
written, and combined it with the files that existed in my C++ sandbox
repository. I'm working on cleaning everything up, improving documentation,
unit tests and getting continous integration going. Once things are stable
I will label a build.

For the moment this is a very much work in progress. The code works well,
it's just not packaged up perfectly yet.

Feel free to contact me with questions. If you have a specific problem with
this code that's preventing you from using it, let me know. I'll make it
a priority to get it fixed.
